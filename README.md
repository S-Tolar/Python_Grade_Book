# In this Python 3 project I put together lists using what I learned.
# I learned how to create lists and 2d lists. 
# I learned how to modify lists by using the append/remove function.
# Plus how to modify specific indexes.
# All in all this project was a lot of fun and has taught me I have a long way to go!
